#The following program implements the HangMan game. There will be 2 players for this game.
#The first player will input a string (secret word) for the second player to guess.
#After the first player inputs a secret word, each character in the secret word will be
#replaced with '?', and when the second player guesses a letter correct, the '?' will flip over
#and reveal the letter in the '?' position for the word. Everytime the player guesses incorrectly,
#a bodypart of the hangman is revealed. The second player will lose if the secret word is not guessed
#and the entire man hung, is revealed.

#This is the picture of the hangman for each letter guessed wrong. The body part will be shown in order
#until all the body parts are shown, or when the secret word is guessed. The picture starts with the string that
#hangs the person, then the head, body, arms and legs.
